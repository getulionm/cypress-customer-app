# Cypress test automation #

Welcome to this test automation framework using Cypress.  
Cypress is a modern solution in test automation, allowing for reliable test execution and minimal configuration.  

Aiming for a simple execution, a single Cypress package installation was added, were both API and UI tests can be executed.  
Please see the ***MD files for each completed task in /tasks folder*** for full description.  

My main objectives on this task is:
- Reveal inconsistencies in the expected results and actual results during software testing.
- Identify root cause of failures and report.
- Create tests that are simple to read and execute.  
- Create tests dynamically, based on static data used.
- Separate reusable methods, for proper scalability and maintainability (adding and removing tests must be simple)

Looking forward to discuss the solutions implemented and get to hear more about how you do testing!
Thank you for your time and attention.

Happy testing!
